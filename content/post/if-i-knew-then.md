So you're a young, hungry start up. You've got a great idea, talented people and
investors fighting to give you your seed money. Stop, and think, because if you don't
you'll give your fledgling company a cancer.

Now don't get me wrong, it's not an incurable cancer and it may not be terminal.
But one of the differences between being a Unicorn or a written off investment is
how your company grows and adapts later in it's development. If you're not keeping
one eye on a long-term philosophy, it's going to bite you.

By day 0, I mean the day before I start building, the day before we break ground.
On that day I'm going to pick my tools, decide on a philosophy.
