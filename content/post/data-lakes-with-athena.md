# Data Lakes? Huh? What? Water and computers don't mix

No, no they don't. But we're talking about a lake OF data. Traditionally, the approach
taken to big data is structured, in the for of Data Warehouses. Essentially enormous
relational databases with umpteen indexes, often using Oracle or some other mega-expensive
system. [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DataLake.html) wrote an excellent (as usual)
article a couple of years ago, I'm not going to do better, so this is really more
about a Data Lake Newb trying to get up and running using Amazon Athena.
