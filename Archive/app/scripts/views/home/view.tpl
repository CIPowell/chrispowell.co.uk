<h2>About me</h2>
<section class="main">
  <p class="lead">
   Currently the Lead Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.weswap.com/en">WeSwap.com</a>.
   I'm a great believer that being a developer isn't just about building against requirements.
   Software Engineers need to add value, to anticipate the need to expand code. I also believe
   that no Engineer should have one langage to work from. I've used PHP, C#, Node.js, Go, Elixir
   professionally on the backend, as well and Angular, LESS and SCSS on the front end.
